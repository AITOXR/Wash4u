"""Generate src/data/coverage-pages.json — the registry for the non-Gurugram
service-area ("coverage") pages.

Why this file exists
--------------------
areas.json lists localities in Delhi, Noida & Greater Noida, Faridabad and
Ghaziabad as covered. Wash4You has NO shop, counter or processing unit in any
of those cities — both stores are in Gurugram. So these pages are deliberately
a different page type from the Gurugram area pages in area-pages.json:

  * they never name a "nearest store" in that city,
  * they carry an explicit line saying there is no branch there and that the
    cleaning happens in Gurugram,
  * their schema is a Service with an areaServed Place — never a LocalBusiness
    with a local address,
  * they promise no turnaround time, no same-day delivery, no local landmark
    knowledge, and invent no societies, builders or testimonials.

Copy is composed from structured fields (city, zone, locality, locality kind)
against per-city sentence banks, with the variant chosen deterministically from
a hash of the slug, so no two pages are the same paragraph with the name
swapped. Re-running this script is idempotent.

# Second body section: how a booking from a non-Gurugram address actually works.
HOW_IT_WORKS = [
    "## How a collection from {loc} is arranged\n\n"
    "You call or WhatsApp **{phone}** and tell us roughly what is coming — a weekly "
    "wash, four suits, a set of curtains, a quilt. Because {loc} is outside "
    "Gurugram, we do not hand you a two-hour slot on the spot; we tell you which "
    "day we can be in {city} and fix a window on that day. At the door everything "
    "is counted in front of you and written on a receipt, so the list you sign is "
    "the list we clean. The same receipt comes back with the order.",

    "## What actually happens after you book\n\n"
    "A booking from {loc} is a scheduled run, not a local errand, so the first "
    "thing we do is agree a day. After that it is the same process as anywhere "
    "else: we count the pieces with you at the door, note anything already stained "
    "or already damaged, and give you a written receipt. The load travels to "
    "Gurugram, is sorted by fabric rather than by customer, and comes back to the "
    "same address. Call or WhatsApp **{phone}** to start it.",

    "## Booking from outside Gurugram\n\n"
    "Tell us what you have and where in {city} you are, and we will tell you the "
    "next day we can reach {loc} — a real answer rather than a promise we cannot "
    "keep. Nothing is collected before that day is agreed. Everything is counted at "
    "your door against a written receipt, and delicate or dry-clean-only pieces are "
    "flagged there and then rather than discovered later. **{phone}**.",

    "## The practical part\n\n"
    "Collections in {loc} run to an agreed day rather than an on-demand slot, "
    "because the van is coming from Gurugram. Once the day is set, the rest is "
    "ordinary: doorstep count, written receipt, sorted and cleaned by fabric at our "
    "plant, returned to the same door. Free both ways, whatever the size of the "
    "load. Book on **{phone}** or over WhatsApp.",

    "## From the first call to the doorstep\n\n"
    "Step one is a conversation, not a form: ring or message **{phone}**, say you "
    "are in {loc} and describe the load. Step two is a date — we name the next day "
    "we are running into {city} and you say whether it works. Step three is the "
    "doorstep count, itemised and signed. After that the order is out of your hands "
    "until it comes back, and the receipt is how you check it.",

    "## What we ask you to do, and what we do\n\n"
    "Your side is short: tell us what you have, be there when we said, and take the "
    "curtains down before we arrive if curtains are part of it. Our side is the "
    "rest — the run out to {loc}, the count at the door, the sorting by fabric, the "
    "cleaning at the Gurugram plant and the return to the same address. Free both "
    "ways. **{phone}**.",

        "come out for eight weeks and then need cleaning before they go back into "
        "storage, the living-room curtains nobody has taken down in two years, the "
        "sofa covers that have quietly gone a shade darker. Those are the pieces we "
        "are asked for most from flats in {loc}, alongside the weekly wash-and-fold "
        "and a steady run of office shirts that want proper steam pressing rather "
        "than a domestic iron.",

        "## The usual load from {loc}\n\n"
        "Weekly wash and fold, office wear pressed properly, and — on a slower "
        "rhythm — the heavy household textiles. Curtains and blinds, carpets and "
        "rugs, mattress and upholstery cleaning, quilts and blankets at the turn of "
        "the season. There is also the specialist end of it: leather jackets and "

        "those are exactly the items a home machine cannot take. From {loc} we are "

        "steam pressed, school and office wear on a weekly cycle. The other half is "
        "the household stuff that builds up quietly in an older, larger home in "

        "and colour rather than by household; curtains, carpets and upholstery are "
        "counted separately and priced by the piece; leather and shoes go to the "
        "people who do only that.",

        "## The range we actually cover\n\n"

        "collection from {loc} can carry a week of ordinary clothes, two suits for "
        "dry cleaning, a quilt, a pair of shoes and a set of curtains — each priced "
        "on its own line, each counted at the door. The price list on this site is "

        "doing far more often than anyone admits, and a jacket or a formal shirt "

    ("How soon can you collect from {loc}?",

     "is agreed we hold it."),

     "have, and we will fix a collection day. You can also use the booking link at "
     "the top of this page."),
    ("How is my laundry counted?",
     "Piece by piece at your door, in front of you, and written onto a receipt "
     "before it leaves. The same receipt comes back with the order so you can check "
     "it off yourself."),

     "Bulk plans exist for PGs, hostels, co-living operators and corporate sites. "
     "Volumes and collection frequency decide the quote, so call **{phone}** and "
     "describe the site rather than expecting a number off a page."),
    ("What if something is already stained or damaged?",
     "We note it on the receipt at pickup, in front of you, before anything is "
     "taken. Some stains do not come out and we will tell you that at the door "
     "rather than after the fact."),
    ("Do you charge more because {loc} is outside Gurugram?",
     "No. The rate card is the same one published on this site, and collection and "
     "delivery are free. The difference is scheduling, not price."),
    ("Can I drop clothes off myself instead?",
     "Only at the Gurugram counters — Sushant Lok Phase I, Sector 43, or Unitech "
     "Arcadia in Sector 49. There is no drop-off point in {city}, which is exactly "
     "why the doorstep collection is free."),
    ("Which services can I combine in one pickup from {loc}?",
     "All fifteen. Wash and fold, dry cleaning, steam ironing, curtains, carpets, "
     "sofas, mattresses, blankets, shoes, bags, leather and accessories can travel "
     "on the same collection and are billed line by line."),
